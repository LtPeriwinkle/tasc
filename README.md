# tasc

An interpreter for [tas-script](https://github.com/hamhub7/tas-script). Easy way to get blind input feeding on emulator in the same way as on real hardware.

Will use [vigembus](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus) on windows to emulate controller inputs for another program, like yuzu or cemu.

Eventual goals include compilation so that the tas can easily be run whenever, support of the nxtas format as well as tiger, and possible linux support using some other method of spoofing a controller.
